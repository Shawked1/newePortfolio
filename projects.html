                <h3>Deck Of <span>Cards</span></h3>
                <p>This was a app we had created in JavaScript in our first Client Side Application course.
                     It is a simple
                    app that pulls a deck of cards from a API and shuffles them each time its loaded to reveal a new 5
                     card hand, the app then
                    can detect if the user has a hand that is known in poker based on some
                     conditional statements. Simple yet Effective.
                </p>

                <h3>Sorting <span>Hat</span></h3>
                <p>Following the theme of simple applications this sorting hat app lived in the console output stages,
                     it asks the user for first
                    and last name, and based on those conditions it sorts them into one of the 
                    4 houses of the hit film harry potter, this was very early on
                    in our introduction to writing loops and conditional statements, was very fun to do.</p>

                <h3>Rolodex <span>Page</span></h3>
                <p>This application was one of the more dificult things that we had done in the first term of year 2,
                     altho we did not get to a point
                    where this app displayed everything it needed, it had the fundementals.
                     This app had full CRUD functionality and authentication, It allowed
                    a logged in user to create a post of an image and some other data,
                     that was then stored on a local DB hosted in a docker container. This was a super
                    fun project and was very intresting to learn about docker as this was our first introduction to it.

                <h3>Bus <span>Mapping with GeoJson</span></h3>
                <p>As this was what would have seemed to be the most dificult app we built,
                     it consisted very little code, we pulled a API down provided
                    by our professer that housed all the information for metro transits routes,
                     we then used GeoJson and Leaflet to plot the API data onto
                    a map of the city, you could see the busses move in real time, that updated
                     every 10 seconds, Looking back this was one of my favorite projects.</p>

                <h3>Social Media <span>Application</span></h3>
                <p>Introduction to PHP, this was the first time using a Framework and using PHP,
                     this was a laravel application that housed a SQL database ran on
                    docker that was later converted to SQLite, this had users and roles,
                     along with authentication you could log into the app and make a post, with a detailed
                    content section, based on what user was logged in you had CRUD functionality on your own posts,
                     or if admin/moderator you could take action on everyones
                    posts. Learning PHP was very fun as most new languages are fun to learn,
                     we also got introduced to PDO statements in this implementation, protecting our
                    app from bad actors.

                <h3>Quizz <span>App</span></h3>
                <p>This one is a doozy, we have very little experience with newish frameworks 
                    and altho nextJS is not new using server actions to pass props to other
                    components is very new to us, this was alot of late night googling 
                    to get this thing working,
                     but along with that comes learning, this app loads
                    5 questions from a Quiz API provided, it then allows the user to select 
                    true or false and sent that info off to a action,
                     that then determins
                    the correct answer and compares it to the selected answer, 
                    this application had the best of me, but i will explore more at a later date.</p>
